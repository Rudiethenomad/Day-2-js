/* EXERCISE 1
 Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/
/*
//  The number datatype will run a specific number as belwow, can be any number up to 15 digits
let number =7  
console.log(number)

// Undefined indicates when a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all like below. there is nothing after like (= 20) so it will return a result of undefined.
let Jon
console.log(Jon)

// Object are a collection of the key value properites as the example below and will return the result of the variables added together
 let Operators = (6 + 1)
console.log(Operators)

// Strings are words or character inside " " like in the example below
let string = "HomeworkIsAwsome"
console.log(string)

// Boolean is a something that can only be answered as yes or no as below

 let  jackpot = true
 let bust = false
let hand = 22 
 console.log(jackpot)

//  Null used to empty datatpe there is nothing there like below
let extream = null
console.log (extream)
*/

 

/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/

/* 
// A Variable is a place to store data as below. crime is the variable
let crime = punishment
console.log (crime)

*/

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* 
let first = 12
let second = 20
let sum = (first + second)
console.log (first + second)
console.log (sum)

*/

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

/* let x = 12
console.log (x)
*/

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it the string "John Doe".
*/

/* 
let name ="John Doe"
console.log (name)

*/

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* 
let theman = 12
let sum = (x - theman)
console.log (x - theman)
console.log (sum)

*/

/* EXERCISE 7
 Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

/* 
let name1 = "john"
let name2 = "John"
console.log (name1===name2)
console.log (name1!==name2)

*/

/* EXERCISE 8
 Create a variable named x, and assign to it a numeric value less than 10.
 Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1, it should print "one", if x is 5 it should print "five" etc.).
*/

/* 

let x = 9
let y = "nine"
if (x===9) {y}
console.log (y)

*/

/* EXERCISE 9
 [Extra] Assign a value to a variable using a ternary operator (this topic has not been covered during lesson yet,
 try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together!)
*/

/* 
let age = 60
let socialSecurity = age >= 65 ? "pension" : "noPension"
console.log (socialSecurity)

*/
